SYNOPSIS

  ignite baseline SUBCOMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARG...]
  ignite baseline [-h|--help|-V|--version]

DESCRIPTION

  Baseline topology commands.

OPTIONS

  -h, --help                  - show this help message and exit.

  -V, --version               - print version information and exit.

SUBCOMMANDS

  add <consistentId1,...>     - to add a list of nodes to the baseline topology, run the command given below. After the node
                                is added, the rebalancing process starts.

  remove <consistentId1,...>  - to remove a list of nodes from the baseline topology, use the remove command. Only offline nodes
                                can  be removed from the baseline topology: shut down the node first and then use the remove command.
                                This operation starts the rebalancing process, which re-distributes the data across the nodes
                                that remain in the baseline topology.

  set                         - to set new baseline topology

                                  --version <topology>             - to set the baseline topology by specifying the desired version
                                                                     of the baseline topology.

                                  -n, --nodes <consistentId1,...>  - to set the baseline topology by either providing a list of
                                                                     nodes (consistent IDs).

  list                        - to get the list of nodes registered in the baseline topology. The output contains the current
                                topology version, the list of consistent IDs of the nodes included in the baseline topology,
                                and the list of nodes that joined the cluster but were not added to the baseline topology.

  auto_adjust                 - baseline topology autoadjustment refers to automatic update of baseline topology after the
                                topology has been stable for a specific amount of time. For in-memory clusters, autoadjustment
                                is enabled by default with the timeout set to 0. It means that baseline topology changes
                                immediately after server nodes join or leave the cluster. For clusters with persistence,
                                the automatic baseline adjustment is disabled by default.

                                  -e, --enable   - to enable autoadjustment

                                  -t, --timeout  - a timeout is set in milliseconds. The baseline is set to the current
                                                   topology when a given number of milliseconds has passed after the last
                                                   JOIN/LEFT/FAIL event. Every new JOIN/LEFT/FAIL event restarts the timeout
                                                   countdown.

EXIT STATUS

       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.
